# Dino-Zombie-Game
A mini shooting game using pygame.

Just a fun project in which we are a cute dino and we should shoot our enemy zombie as manay times as possible.
Each hit counts as a score and each collision makes you lose some health.
High Score will be stored in data.txt.

Just give it a try...
